This is a Java-based chat application that allows users to register, log in, and participate in group chat rooms. The application features a client-server architecture, with the server handling multiple client connections and broadcasting messages to all connected clients.

### Description

The Java Chat Application is a desktop application built using JavaFX for the client-side user interface and Java for the server-side logic. Users can create an account by providing their personal information, such as name, email, and phone number. Once registered, users can log in and join the chat room.
The chat room interface allows users to view and send messages to all connected clients. Users can also update their profile information, including their profile picture. The application stores user data and message history locally, ensuring that user preferences and chat history are preserved across sessions.
